#' Simulated data on Mosquito Abundance
#' 
#' Mosquitos are a very common disease vector and understanding the climactic
#' drivers of large mosquito populations will be helpful to understand disease 
#' outbreaks and how disease might change in the face of climate change. 
#' 
#' This data set simulates an observational study where we observe a number 
#' of communities and record an abundance measurement along with pertinent 
#' covariates.
